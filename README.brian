- I added an example test for the DatabaseConfiguration class to complete the task of starting the testing framework
- I added DatabaseLoader.java which starts an embedded MySQL instance to complete the task of creating a method to setup
a database instance

Notes: A majority of my time was spent debugging issues with the embedded MySQL library. After solving various issues,
the resulting DatabaseLoader.java will load a MySQL instance, load a schema, run a test on a table, and close the
connection and MySQL instance.
