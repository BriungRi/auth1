2/15:
- I set up the Spring Boot dependencies and built a dummy endpoint to learn how to use the framework.

Notes: We initially had planned on building an API stub at this time, but decided it would be unnecessary given how simple
it is to set up routes in Spring Boot, and that we weren't working on any features which depended on it
